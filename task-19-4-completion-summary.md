# Task 19.4: Integrate with DAG Orchestration - Completion Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the enhanced cleanup system with the DAG orchestration framework to provide seamless cleanup operations within the task execution workflow.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Cleanup Task Implementations (`cleanup_dag_tasks.go`)

Created DAG-compatible task implementations for cleanup operations:

- **SnapshotCleanupTask**: Individual snapshot cleanup with error handling
- **SessionCleanupTask**: Session-level cleanup with failure tolerance
- **EmergencyCleanupTask**: Emergency cleanup for expired snapshots
- **HealthCheckTask**: Health monitoring for cleanup operations

Key features:
- Implements the DAG Task interface with Execute() and Rollback() methods
- Integrates with ResilientCleanupManager for advanced error handling
- Provides structured logging and error reporting
- Includes health checks as part of the cleanup workflow

### 2. Task Execution Framework (`CleanupTaskExecutor`)

Created a simplified task execution framework that avoids circular imports:

- **CleanupTaskExecutor**: Manages execution of cleanup tasks without full DAG complexity
- **Sequential Execution**: Executes tasks in order with proper error handling
- **Health Monitoring**: Includes health checks before and after cleanup operations
- **Error Tolerance**: Configurable failure tolerance for different cleanup levels

### 3. Cleanup Orchestration (`cleanup_orchestrated_migration.go`)

Enhanced migration orchestration with integrated cleanup:

- **CleanupOrchestrator**: Manages cleanup operations within the migration workflow
- **Snapshot Tracking**: Tracks active snapshots by task and session
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: Background health monitoring and emergency cleanup
- **OrchestatedMigrationOrchestrator**: Extended migration orchestrator with cleanup integration

Key features:
- Register/unregister snapshots during migration
- Execute task-level cleanup after successful migrations
- Automatic emergency cleanup when snapshot count exceeds thresholds
- Real-time health monitoring and alerting

## Integration Points

### 1. Migration Workflow Integration
- Snapshot registration during disk migration
- Automatic cleanup after successful task completion
- Session-level cleanup at migration end
- Emergency cleanup for expired snapshots

### 2. Health Monitoring Integration
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance
- Periodic health checks with configurable intervals
- Alert generation for cleanup failures
- Metrics collection and aggregation

### 3. Error Handling Integration
- Resilient cleanup with retry logic
- Error classification and categorization
- Circuit breaker protection
- Comprehensive error logging and metrics

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Modular Design
- Clean separation between cleanup logic and orchestration
- Pluggable task implementations
- Configurable execution strategies

### 2. Fault Tolerance
- Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascade failures
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Health monitoring with automatic recovery

### 3. Scalability
- Concurrent cleanup operations with semaphore control
- Background scheduled maintenance
- Configurable cleanup thresholds and limits

### 4. Observability
- Comprehensive logging with structured fields
- Metrics collection for monitoring
- Alert generation for operational issues

## Usage Examples

### Basic Cleanup Orchestration
```go
// Create cleanup orchestrator
orchestrator := NewCleanupOrchestrator(config, gcpClients, sessionID)

// Register snapshots during migration
orchestrator.RegisterSnapshot(taskID, snapshotName)

// Execute cleanup after task completion
err := orchestrator.ExecuteTaskCleanup(ctx, completedTaskID)

// Execute session cleanup at end
err = orchestrator.ExecuteSessionCleanup(ctx)
```

### Enhanced Migration with Cleanup
```go
// Create orchestrated migration orchestrator
migrationOrchestrator, err := NewOrchestatedMigrationOrchestrator(
    config, resourceLocker, progressTracker, sessionID)

// Perform migration with integrated cleanup
result := migrationOrchestrator.MigrateInstanceWithCleanup(ctx, job)

// Access cleanup metrics
metrics := migrationOrchestrator.GetCleanupOrchestrator().GetCleanupMetrics()
```

## Testing Results
- ✅ All builds successful
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ No circular import issues
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Integration with existing codebase

## Next Steps
This integration provides the foundation for Task 19.5: Enhance CLI with Cleanup Commands, which will add command-line interfaces for managing cleanup operations.
